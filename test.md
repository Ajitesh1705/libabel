Got bored and built...

THE CANVAS OF BABEL
An infinite array of every possible arrangement of pixels.
Contained images: the moment of your death, every frame of Shrek 2, the inside of a black hole, your bank password...

Me and @AviSchiffmann were talking about building this and turns out it's super easy: P5.js is awesome.
If this gets enough interest I'll build the search algorithm for you to find where any image is located on the canvas.
